# How I became a Web Developer

### Introduction

This is not you **how to become a web developer course** but more of a **How I did** kind of post. It is a series of posts where I tell my story, here's a list of "chapters":

#### How I became a Web Developer. Part one
1. Learning to Code take 1.
2. First contact with Web Developement.
3. Learning to Code take 2
4. Welcome to the rabbit hole.
5. Landing my first position.
6. Time to revaluate.
7. The fourth thme's the charm.
8. Cowboy up, or wait in the truck.

###  1. Learning to Code take 1

During my life, I was first introduced to coding in highscool, around 2007. It was a required course for those who wanted to become engineers I didn't have much choise. 
  <br>
  <br> 
There we would learn about variables, data types and loops in Pascal. Despite their good intentions, <!--more-->
the education we recieved there was rather messy, most relevant programing languages are written in English. Since neither the teacher nor the students were English speakers, so debuggin errors like 
```pascal
Error : This must be a boolean value.
```

was increadible frustrating since we couldn't understand the documantation and the teacher was not the best explaining. Most lessons where focused on the logic of things like a `fo reach` loop rather than building something useful.

### 2. First contact with Web Developement

This was also a required course by the school. They would teach us during a semester how to create basic HTML static websites with some inline CSS. SEO optimization was not that relevant. All we learned was relevant, screen resolution was not something to worry about, that lasted two months until the first iPhone was introduced to the market.
  <br>
  <br>
The project was suposed to have working links to at leat four pages, it was hosted on some "Yahoo Sites" freemium service. I remeber spending a whole night trying to upload my project before the deadline, I deprived my self from sleeping just to find that I've had everything done three weeks before the deadline.

### 3. Learning to code take 2

This was somewhere around 2012. Now as a Industrial Robotics Engineering student, I was required to learn **Programing Fundamentals**. The programing language was C++. 
  <br>
  <br>

And it very similar to what I experienced in highschool. We were *introduced* to fundamentals like data types, variables and the concept of IDE. 
  <br>
  <br>
Same mistakes, new envyronment. This time I was the only English speaker in the room. I learned most of what I needed on the internet while eating pizza during the weekend, it was interesting but no one never showed us what you could be capable. 

### 4. I want to develop an app for Android

After the course was finished, no more programing was taught in the course, at least not for two years. I looked for resourses but could find a site that was newbie friendoly. Then I started to look for a local programing ~~camp, course, school, lord of the code~~ or someone who could teach me how to it. 
  <br>
  <br>
I found a free conference about how to get started. I got lost looking for the place since the adress was not the actual location. While being lost I made a friend, but never an app.
