### 7. Landing my first position.

After three months I started to look for remote and local positions. A nice website really can get you a foot on the door. 
  <br>
  <br>
**First interview**. It was for a Web Designer position, I arrived on time but choose not to show up because the facade of the place scared me and it didn't look like a place where I would like to work.
  <br>
  <br>
**Second Interview.** This time I was applying for a PHP Developer position. I felt really underqualified, most of my PHP experience was based on WordPress and a contact form. I haven't take the time to learn Laravel or some other PHP framework.
  <br>
  <br>
**Third Interview**. This was a Front End Developer position in startup. They had a really small team of no more than five people. The founder who was supossed to run the interview had to leave because  of an emergency, his assistant did the interview instead, she asked me to review the design of  a pamphlet, she was excited because of my response. It felt so close and real. She told me she'd talk to her boss on Monday and call me back if required. It wasn't. 
  <br>
  <br>
 I visited some events in the local PHP comunity and every time I visited I felt dumb. They were welcoming people but every speaker talked about things way beyond my area of expertise. I spent another month inmersed in learning web development before trying again.
  <br>
  <br>
Despite never having a job before, this [this iteration of my website](http://riosjaime.com) was good enough to got me a foot on the door, or at least it was until the spam attack.
  <br>
  <br>
**Fourth interview**. The position was as a Front End Developer with PHP. This was a consulting agency or something like that, they shared offices with an internet provider and had a great view. I was a good fit, three weeks passed and they didn't called me back. 
  <br>
  <br>
**Fifth interview**. It was a Front End Developer position, I've applied before but they didn't remember, I didn't tell them and that time I got a call but never made it to the interview. This was an agency that worked with Magento, they had a Graphic Designer, someone to do the backend and needed someone who could use Bootstrap, CSS and that basic kind of stuff. This time I was a perfect fit.
  <br>
  <br>
They wouldn't pay much, but would teach warranty a Magento Certification. I was unawere of what Magento could do for me and the value of the education they would offer so I declined the offer.
