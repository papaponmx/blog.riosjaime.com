### 8. Cowboy up or wait in the truck.

He gave me a flash drive with the files, it was so messy. Inline-css, no VCS, no BEM convention, no gulp, no sassy SASS and no media queryes allowed. Even Team Treehouse has a course dedicated to explain what a modern workflow looks like.

> I don't always run tests, but when I do, I do in production.

IE compatibility was first, responsive web design was second.Instead of coding, I would go with him and seek to understand why did the client made that decision, he didin't. Earl did.
  <br>
  <br>
So we spent the rest of day arguing. I would not be a cowboy, he refused to use SASS. I've read Dale Carnegie's book several times, and I was trying to be respectful. He wasn't, he went over my portfolio and started to "criticize" my work. 
  <br>
  <br>
Despite all of this, it was a problem of education, he had a major in Computer SCience, I had a never stop learning paradimg. He was not a bad person, he was doing what he has been thaught.
  <br>
  <br>
I went to HR and explained the situation and said that despite of my three-months-contract being signed, I wanted to take the rest of the week and evaluate if it was still a win win for both parts. Yup, I literally said that. She proposed to talk to the boss aka, our Project Manager the next morning. 
  <br>
  <br>
The next morning arrived. The Project Manager propossed to give me a new project to tackle alone on Friday, do it ***"my way"*** and then evaluate results, until then, please help Earl. It seemed reasonable to me. He also agreed to stop supporting IE9.

### 9. Give your ~~heart~~ code a break

This time Earl, was eager to give gulp a try. I would spend all of the day creating a recipe. The bigger problem I had was not writing code but trying to decide, WHAT  the recipe needed to do.
  <br>
  <br>
I gave it to him, it succeeded. The next day he was interested in SCSS. I explained him how to use variables, include partials and a BEM convetion. I also fixed a bug on IE11 which increased the feeling of working as a team.
  <br>
  <br>
Fourth day I had a PSD to work with. I aprecieate the freedom but even PSD feels old. I would expect some Balsamiq Mockup haha.
  <br>
  <br>
Fifht day I quited, That's on me, no one to blame, I just got a gig with another entrepreneur who is more similar to what I want to accomplish in the future.
