title: How I became a web Developer Part 1

---

## Introduction

This is not you **how to become a web developer course** but more of a **How I did it** kind of post. It will be divided at least in two parts:

#### How I became a Web Developer. Part one
1. Learning to Code take 1.
2. First contact with Web Developement.
3. Learning to Code take 2
4. Welcome to the rabbit hole.

## Learning to Code take 1

During my life, I was first introduced to coding in highscool, around 2007. It was a required course for those who wanted to become engineers I didn't have much choise. 
<br>
<br>
There we would learn about variables, data types and loops in Pascal. Despite their good intentions, <!--more-->
the education we recieved there was rather messy, most relevant programing languages are written in English. Since neither the teacher nor the students were English speakers, so debuggin errors like 

```pascal
Error : This must be a boolean value.
```

was incredibly frustrating since we couldn't understand the documentation and the teacher was not the best explaining. Most lessons where focused on the logic of things like a `fo reach` loop rather than building something useful.

## First contact with Web Development

This was also a required course by the school. They would teach us during a semester how to create basic HTML static websites with some inline CSS. SEO optimization was not that relevant. All we learned was relevant, screen resolution was not something to worry about, that lasted two months until the first iPhone was introduced to the market.
<br>
<br>
The project was suposed to have working links to at leat four pages, it was hosted on some "Yahoo Sites" freemium service. I remeber spending a whole night trying to upload my project before the deadline, I deprived my self from sleeping just to find that I've had everything done three weeks before the deadline.

## Learning to code take 2

This was somewhere around 2012. Now as a Industrial Robotics Engineering student, I was required to learn **Programing Fundamentals**. The programing language was C++. 
<br>
<br>
And it very similar to what I experienced in highschool. We were *introduced* to fundamentals like data types, variables and the concept of IDE. 
<br>
<br>
Same mistakes, new envyronment. This time I was the only English speaker in the room. I learned most of what I needed on the internet while eating pizza during the weekend, it was interesting but no one never showed us what you could be capable. 

## I want to develop an app for Android

After the course was finished, no more programing was taught in the course, at least not for two years. I looked for resourses but could find a site that was newbie friendoly. Then I started to look for a local programing ~~camp, course, school, lord of the code~~ or someone who could teach me how to it. 
<br>
<br>
I found a free conference about how to get started. I got lost looking for the place since the adress was not the actual location. While being lost I made a friend, but never an app.

## Walking into the rabbit hole

Three years forward, now in 2015. I dropped out of collage because of what started reading several books about finances. Ideas like a job won't make you rich, you need passive income, your college degree does not define you, I was naive and disturbed, it made me realize that most of what I learn would be irrelevant in a few years at best. Out of social preassure I decided to study administration in at open university system at UNAM. 
<br>
<br>
I had a friend who was trying to start a company and needed to make a website, I was trying to help and ended up watching a video about how to make a responsive website on WordPress. It was a three hours long tutorial with ads included.
<br>
<br>
One of those ads, was about how everyone could learn how to code and change their lives forever. I saw more videos in the adviser's chanel, it was 
<br>
Despite my first attempt to develope and Android App was a failure, times has changed so fast, now it was easier to learn. The advisor described it self as an online academy called [Treehouse](http://referrals.trhou.se/jaimemadrigalrios). For me, it was more like a Netflix for coding, it was so damn addictive. 
<br>
<br>
They had this 15 days free trial, it took me an hour to make my decision. My premise was that I could learn how to code in six months, get a remote position, earn US dollars and live in mexican pesos. I was on summer vacations and my day would be divided into three activities, sleep, eat and learn. I spent a month or two like that so my learning curve was not that steep.
<br>
<br>
According to my Treehouse Accout, I've been actively learning for six months with some month-long breaks in between, some of them because of school, family.

## Teach me how to ~~*dougie*~~  code it

I relearned some basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Then SASS, Flexbox, jQuery you name it. Since WordPress required it, I learned some PHP as well.
<br>
<br>
I've developed several iterations of [my personal portfolio](http://riosjaime.com). Vanilla CSS & HTML, then Flexbox, then SASS, then Bootstrap, then Foundation, Wordpress multiple pages, Wordpress Single page, then just PHP and Foundation. Everyone was awesome and satisfied me for a week or so, until I learned some other new technology. 
<br>
<br>
I designed the last iteration for a whole weekend before applying for Front End Developer/ Web Design positions again, my fascination lasted three weeks until some robot/hacker started to send codes to my server at a rate of 3 per minute or something, by the time I disabled the form I've recieved about 131 emails. It was time to learn some more PHP. 

## Landing my first position.

After three months I started to look for remote and local positions. A nice website really can get you a foot on the door. 
<br>
<br>
The First interview. It was for a Web Designer position, I arrived on time but choose not to show up because the facade of the place scared me and it didn't look like a place where I would like to work.
<br>
<br>
Second Interview. This time I was applying for a PHP Developer position. I felt really underqualified, most of my PHP experience was based on WordPress and a contact form. I haven't take the time to learn Laravel or some other PHP framework.
<br>
<br>
Third. This was a Front End Developer position in startup. They had a really small team of no more than five people. The founder who was supossed to run the interview had to leave because  of an emergency, his assistant did the interview instead, she asked me to review the design of  a pamphlet, she was excited because of my response. It felt so close and real. She told me she'd talk to her boss on Monday and call me back if required. It wasn't. 
<br>
<br>
 I visited some events in the local PHP comunity and every time I visited I felt dumb. They were welcoming people but every speaker talked about things way beyond my area of expertise. I spent another month inmersed in learning web development before trying again.
<br>
<br>
Despite never having a job before, this [this iteration of my website](http://riosjaime.com) was good enough to got me a foot on the door, or at least it was until the spam attack.
<br>
<br>
Fourth. The position was as a Front End Developer with PHP. This was a consulting agency or something like that, they shared offices with an internet provider and had a great view. I was a good fit, three weeks passed and they didn't called me back. 
<br>
<br>
Fifth. It was a Front End Developer position, I've applied before but they didn't remember, I didn't tell them and that time I got a call but never made it to the interview. 
<br>
<br>
This was an agency that worked with Magento, they had a Graphic Designer, someone to do the backend and needed someone who could use Bootstrap, CSS and that basic kind of stuff. This time I was a perfect fit.
 <br>
 <br>
They wouldn't pay much, but would teach warranty a Magento Certification. I was anawere of what Magento could do for me so I declined the offer.
