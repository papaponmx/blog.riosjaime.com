### 5. Walking into the rabbit hole

Three years forward, now in 2015. I dropped out of collage because of what started reading several books about finances. Ideas like a job won't make you rich, you need passive income, your college degree does not define you, I was naive and disturbed, it made me realize that most of what I learn would be irrelevant in a few years at best. Out of social preassure I decided to study administration in at open university system at UNAM. 
  <br>
  <br>
I had a friend who was trying to start a company and needed to make a website, I was trying to help and ended up watching a video about how to make a responsive website on WordPress. It was a three hours long tutorial with ads included.
  <br>
  <br>
One of those ads, was about how everyone could learn how to code and change their lives forever. I saw more videos in the adviser's chanel, it was 
  <br>
  <br>
Despite my first attempt to develope and Android App was a failure, times has changed so fast, now it was easier to learn. The advisor described it self as an online academy called [Treehouse](http://referrals.trhou.se/jaimemadrigalrios). For me, it was more like a Netflix for coding, it was so damn adictive. 
  <br>
  <br>
They had this 15 days free trial, it took me an hour to make my decision. My premise was that I could learn how to code in six months, get a remote position, earn US dollars and live in mexican pesos. I was on summer vacations and my day would be divided into three activities, sleep, eat and learn. I spent a month or two like that so my learning curve was not that steep.
  <br>
  <br>
According to my Treehouse Accout, I've been actively learning for six months with some month-long breaks in between, some of them because of school, family.

### 6. Teach me how to ~~*dougie*~~  *code it*

I relearned some basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Then SASS, Flexbox, jQuery you name it. Since WordPress required it, I learned some PHP as well.
  <br>
  <br>
I've developed several iterations of [my personal portfolio](http://riosjaime.com). 

1. Vanilla CSS & HTML version 
2. Flexbox version.
3.  SASS version, 
4. Bootstrap version. 
5. Foundation version. 
6. 6.Wordpress multiple pages version 
7. Wordpress Single page version. 
8. Vanilla PHP and Foundation version.

Every version looked  awesome and satisfied me for a week or so, until I learned some other new technology. 
  <br>
  <br>
Last iteration for a whole weekend before applying for Front End Developer/ Web Design positions again, my fascination lasted three weeks until some robot/hacker started to send codes to my server at a rate of 3 per minute or something, by the time I disabled the form I've recieved about 131 emails. It was time to learn some more PHP in order to prevent this attack from happening again.
