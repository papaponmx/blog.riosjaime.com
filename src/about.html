      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>You may call me James. I'm from Mexico City, born in Tabasco, yup, just like the sauce.
      <br>
      <br>
         Developing for the web since 2015, helping online businesses, entrepreneurs, users and organizations reach their goals faster, by developing faster, useful and responsive websites.
      <br>
      <br>
        I spent at least five hours a week learning and/or reading, sharpening the saw, as Stephen Covey would say. Other than traveling, I also enjoy dancing salsa and bachata, I do like tacos and mojitos are my personal favorite.

  <h2>About what I do</h2>

  <p>I see like this: Websites are solutions to people's problems. A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all, therefore I find the right problem and then fulfill human needs.

  <h2>About this website</h2>

  <p>I do care about performance, usability and accessibility. That's why I use Jekyll instead of a CMS like WordPress for this site. All of the content is gziped. Most of the content, and half of the words have been removed in order to improve usability. You can see the code and tools used for <a href="https://github.com/papaponmx/blog.riosjaime.com/blob/master/README.md">this site on github</a>.
