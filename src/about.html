      <h1>About what I do</h1>


      <p>I see like this: Websites are solutions to people's problems. A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all, therefore I find the right problem and then fulfill human needs.
      </p>




      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>You may call me James. I'm from Mexico City, born in Tabasco, yup, just like the sauce.
      <br>
      <br>
         Developing for the web since 2015, helping online businesses, entrepreneurs, users and organisations reach their goals faster, by developing faster, useful and responsive websites.
      <br>
      <br>
        I spent at least five hours a week learning and/or reading, sharpening the saw, as Stephen Covey would say. Other than traveling, I also enjoy dancing salsa and bachata, I do like tacos and mojitos are my personal favorite.
