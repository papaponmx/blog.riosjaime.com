  <h2>About what I do</h2>


  <p>I see like this: Websites are solutions to people's problems. A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all, therefore I find the right problem and then fulfill human needs.
    <br>
    <br>
    I develop fast and interactive websites. I use the latest technologies on my workflow, so I can focus on what matters, like improving website performance, universal accessibility, best practices and web standards.
